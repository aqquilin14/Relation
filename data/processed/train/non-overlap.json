Examples of data to be ingested may include profile data from a flat file in a CRM system (such as a Parquet file) or data that conforms to a known [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema in the Schema Registry.\n\n## Getting started\n\nIn order to complete this tutorial, you must have access to [!DNL Experience Platform]. If you do not have access to an organization in [!DNL Experience Platform], please speak to your system administrator before proceeding. \n\nIf you would prefer to ingest data using Data Ingestion APIs please begin by reading the [Batch Ingestion developer guide](../batch-ingestion/api-overview.md).\n\n## Datasets workspace\n\nThe Datasets workspace within [!DNL Experience Platform] allows you to view and manage all of the datasets that your organization has made, as well as create new ones. \n\nView the Datasets workspace by clicking **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-hand navigation. The Datasets workspace contains a list of datasets, including columns showing name, created (date and time), source, schema, and last batch status, as well as the date and time the dataset was last updated. \n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Click on the filter icon next to the Search bar to use filtering capabilities to view only those datasets enabled for [!DNL Profile].\n\n![View all datasets](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/datasets-overview.png)\n\n## Create a dataset\n\nTo create a dataset, click **[!UICONTROL Create Dataset]** in the top right corner of the Datasets workspace. \n\n![](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/click-create-datasets.png)\n\nOn the **[!UICONTROL Create Dataset]** screen, select whether you would like to \"[!UICONTROL Create Dataset from Schema]\" or \"[!UICONTROL Create Dataset from CSV File]\". \n\nFor this tutorial, a schema will be used to create the dataset. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Dataset from Schema]** to continue.\n\n![Select data source](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/create-dataset.png)\n\n## Select dataset schema\n\nOn the **[!UICONTROL Select Schema]** screen, choose a schema by clicking the radio button beside the schema you wish to use. For this tutorial, the dataset will be made using the Loyalty Members schema. Using the search bar to filter schemas is a helpful way to find the exact schema you are looking for.\n\nOnce you have selected the radio button next to the schema you wish to use, click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.\n\n![Select schema](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/select-schema.png)\n\n## Configure dataset\n\nOn the **[!UICONTROL Configure Dataset]** screen, you will be required to give your dataset a name and may also provide a description of the dataset as well. \n\n**Notes on Dataset Names:**\n\n- Dataset names should be short and descriptive so that the dataset can be easily found in the library later. \n- Dataset names must be unique, meaning it should also be specific enough that it will not be reused in the future. \n- It is best practice to provide additional information about the dataset using the description field, as it may help other users differentiate between datasets in the future.\n\nOnce the dataset has a name and description, click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**.\n\n![Configure dataset](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/configure-dataset.png)\n\n## Dataset activity\n\nAn empty dataset has now been created and you have been returned to the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** tab in the Datasets workspace. You should see the name of the dataset in the top-left corner of the workspace, along with a notification that \"No batches have been added.\" This is to be expected since you have not added any batches to this dataset yet. \n\nOn the right-hand side of the Datasets workspace you will see the **[!UICONTROL Info]** tab containing information related to your new dataset such as dataset ID, name, description, table name, schema, streaming, and source. The Info tab also includes information about when the dataset was created and its last modified date. \n\nAlso in the Info tab is a  **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle that is used for enabling your dataset for use with [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]. Use of this toggle, and [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile], will be explained in more detail in the section that follows.\n\n![Dataset activity](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/sample-dataset.png)\n\n## Enable dataset for [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]\n\nDatasets are used for ingesting data into [!DNL Experience Platform], and that data is ultimately used to identify individuals and stitch together information coming from multiple sources. That stitched together information is called a [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]. In order for [!DNL Platform] to know which information should be included in the [!DNL Real-Time Profile], datasets can be marked for inclusion using the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle. \n\nBy default, this toggle is off. If you choose to toggle on [!DNL Profile], all data ingested into the dataset will be used to help identify an individual and stitch together their [!DNL Real-Time Profile].\n\nTo learn more about [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] and working with identities, please review the [Identity Service](../../identity-service/home.md) documentation.\n\nTo enable the dataset for [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile], click the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle in the **[!UICONTROL Info]** tab. \n\n![Profile toggle](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/dataset-profile-toggle.png)\n\nA dialog will appear asking you to confirm that you want to enable the dataset for [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile].\n\n![Enable Profile dialog](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/enable-dataset-for-profile.png)\n\nClick **[!UICONTROL Enable]** and the toggle will turn blue, indicating it is on.\n\n![Enabled for Profile](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/profile-enabled-dataset.png)\n\n## Add data to dataset\n\nData can be added into a dataset in a number of different ways. You could choose to use [!DNL Data Ingestion] APIs or an ETL partner such as [!DNL Unifi] or [!DNL Informatica]. For this tutorial, data will be added to the dataset using the **[!UICONTROL Add Data]** tab within the UI.\n\nTo begin adding data to the dataset, click on the **[!UICONTROL Add Data]** tab. You can now drag and drop files or browse your computer for the files you wish to add. \n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Platform supports two files types for data ingestion, Parquet or JSON. You may add up to five files at a time, with the maximum file size of each file being 1 GB.\n\n![Add Data tab](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/drag-and-drop.png)\n\n## Upload a file\n\nOnce you drag and drop (or browse and select) a Parquet or JSON file that you wish to upload, [!DNL Platform] will immediately begin to process the file and an **[!UICONTROL Uploading]** dialog will appear on the **[!UICONTROL Add Data]** tab showing the progress of your file upload.\n\n![Uploading dialog](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/uploading-file.png)\n\n## Dataset metrics\n\nAfter the file has finished uploading, the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** tab no longer shows that \"No batches have been added.\" Instead, the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** tab now shows dataset metrics. All metrics will show \"0\" at this stage as the batch has not yet loaded.\n\nAt the bottom of the tab is a list showing the **[!UICONTROL Batch ID]** of the data that was just ingested through the [\"Add data to dataset\"](#add-data-to-dataset) process. Also included is information related to the batch, including ingested date, number of records ingested, and the current batch status.\n\n![Dataset metrics](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/batch-id.png)\n\n## Batch details\n\nClick on the **[!UICONTROL Batch ID]** to view a **[!UICONTROL Batch Overview]**, showing additional details regarding the batch. Once the batch has finished loading, the information about the batch will update to show the number of records ingested and the file size. The status will also change to \"Success\" or \"Failed\". If the batch fails the **[!UICONTROL Error Code]** section will contain details regarding any errors during ingestion.\n\nFor more information and frequently asked questions regarding batch ingestion, see the [Batch Ingestion troubleshooting guide](../batch-ingestion/troubleshooting.md).\n\nTo return to the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** screen, click the name of the dataset (**[!UICONTROL Loyalty Details]**) in the breadcrumb.\n\n![Batch Overview](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/batch-details.png)\n\n## Preview dataset\n\nOnce the dataset is ready, an option to **[!UICONTROL Preview Dataset]** appears at the top of the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** tab. \n\nClick **[!UICONTROL Preview Dataset]** to open a dialog showing sample data from within the dataset. If the dataset was created using a schema, details for the dataset schema will appear on the left-side of the preview. You can expand the schema using the arrows to see the schema structure. Each column header in the preview data represents a field in the dataset.\n\n![Dataset details](../images/tutorials/ingest-batch-data/dataset-preview.png)\n\n## Next steps and additional resources\n\nNow that you have created a dataset and successfully ingested data into [!DNL Experience Platform], you can repeat these steps to create a new dataset or ingest more data into the existing dataset.\n\nTo learn more about batch ingestion, please read the [Batch Ingestion overview](../batch-ingestion/overview.md) and supplement your learning by watching the video below.\n\n>[!WARNING]\n>\n>The [!DNL Platform] UI shown in the following video is out-of-date. Please refer to the documentation above for the latest UI screenshots and functionality.\n\n>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/27269?quality=12&learn=on)\n",

Despite the failure, it is possible that the operation actually succeeded and the batch was successfully accepted. However, clients are expected to have retry mechanisms in case of API failure, and are, in fact, encouraged to retry. If the operation actually succeeded, the API will return success, even after retrying.\n\n### When should the Large File Upload API be used?\n\nThe recommended file size for using the Large File Upload API is 256 MB or larger. More information about how to use the Large File Upload API can be found [here](./api-overview.md#ingest-large-parquet-files).\n\n### Why is the Large File Complete API call failing?\n\nIf chunks of a large file are found overlapping or missing, the server responds with an HTTP 400 Bad Request. This can occur because it is possible to upload overlapping chunks, as range validations are done at the time of file completion, when the file chunks are stitched together.\n\n## Ingestion Support\n\n### What are the supported ingest formats?\n\nCurrently, both Parquet and JSON are supported. CSV is supported on a legacy basis - while data will be promoted to master and preliminary checks will be done, no modern features, such as conversion, partitioning, or row validation will be supported.\n\n### Where should the batch input format be specified?\n\nThe input format should be specified at batch creation time within the payload. An example of how to specify the batch input format can be seen below:\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST \"https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches\" \\\n  -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: {API_KEY}\"\n  -d '{\n          \"datasetId\": \"{DATASET_ID}\",\n           \"inputFormat\": {\n                \"format\": \"json\"\n           }\n    }'\n```\n\n### Why is the uploaded data not appearing in the dataset?\n\nIn order for data to appear in the dataset, the batch must be marked as complete. All the files you want to ingest must be uploaded before marking the batch as complete. An example of marking a batch as complete can be seen below:\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST \"https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches/{BATCH_ID}?action=COMPLETE\" \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \\\n  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \\\n  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \\\n  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'\n```\n\n### How is multi-line JSON ingested?\n\nTo ingest multi-line JSON, the `isMultiLineJson` flag needs to be set at the time of batch creation. An example of this can be seen below:\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST \"https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches\" \\\n  -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: {API_KEY}\"\n  -d '{\n          \"datasetId\": \"{DATASET_ID}\",\n           \"inputFormat\": {\n                \"format\": \"json\",\n                \"isMultiLineJson\": true\n           }\n      }'\n```\n\n### What is the difference between JSON lines (single-line JSON) and multi-line JSON?\n\nFor JSON lines, there is one JSON object per line. For example:\n\n```json\n{\"string\":\"string1\",\"int\":1,\"array\":[1,2,3],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value1\"}}\n{\"string\":\"string2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[2,4,6],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value2\"}}\n{\"string\":\"string3\",\"int\":3,\"array\":[3,6,9],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value3\", \"extra_key\": \"extra_value3\"}}\n```\n\nFor multi-line JSON, one object can occupy multiple lines, while all the objects are wrapped in a JSON array. For example:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"string\":\"string1\",\"int\":1,\"array\":[1,2,3],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value1\"}},\n    {\"string\":\"string2\",\"int\":2,\"array\":[2,4,6],\"dict\": {\"key\": \"value2\"}},\n    {\n        \"string\": \"string3\",\n        \"int\": 3,\n        \"array\": [\n            3,\n            6,\n            9\n        ],\n        \"dict\": {\n            \"key\": \"value3\",\n            \"extra_key\": \"extra_value3\"\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nBy default, [!DNL Batch Data Ingestion] uses single-line JSON.\n\n### Is CSV ingestion supported?\n\nCSV ingestion is only supported for flat schemas. Currently, ingesting hierarchical data in CSV is not supported.\n\nTo get all the data ingestion features, JSON or Parquet formats need to be used.\n\n### What types of validation are performed on the data?\n\nThere are three levels of validation performed on the data:\n\n- Schema - Batch Ingestion ensures that the schema of the of the ingested data matches the schema of the dataset.\n- Data Type - Batch Ingestion ensures that the type for each field ingested matches the type defined in the schema of the dataset.\n- Constraints - Batch Ingestion ensures constraints, such as \"Required\", \"enum\", and \"format\" are properly defined in the schema definition.\n\n### How can an already ingested batch be replaced?\n\nAn already ingested batch can be replaced by using the Batch Replay feature. More information about Batch Replay can be found [here](./api-overview.md#replay-a-batch).\n\n### How is batch ingestion monitored?\n\nOnce a batch has been signaled for batch promotion, the batch ingestion progress can be monitored with the following request:\n\n```shell\ncurl -X GET \"https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/batches/{BATCH_ID}\" \\\n  -H \"x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: {API_KEY}\"\n```\n\nWith this request, you will get a response similar to this:\n\n```http\n200 OK\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"{BATCH_ID}\":{\n        \"imsOrg\":\"{ORG_ID}\",\n        \"created\":1494349962314,\n        \"createdClient\":\"{API_KEY}\",\n        \"createdUser\":\"{USER_ID}\",\n        \"updatedUser\":\"{USER_ID}\",\n        \"completed\":1494349963467,\n        \"externalId\":\"{EXTERNAL_ID}\",\n        \"status\":\"staging\",\n        \"errors\":[],\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Batch States\n\n### What are the possible batch states?\n\nA batch can, in its lifecycle, go through the following states:\n\n| Status | Data written to Master | Description |\n| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |\n| Abandoned | | The client failed to complete the batch in the expected timeframe. |\n| Aborted | | The client has explicitly called, via the [!DNL Batch Data Ingestion] APIs, an abort operation for the specified batch. Once a batch is in the Loaded state, the batch cannot be aborted. |\n| Active/Success | x | The batch has been successfully promoted from stage to master, and is now available for downstream consumption. **Note:** Active and Success are used interchangeably. |\n| Archived | | The batch has been archived into cold storage. |\n| Failed/Failure | | A terminal state that results from either bad configuration and/or bad data. An actionable error is recorded, along with the batch, to enable clients to correct and resubmit the data. **Note:** Failed and Failure are used interchangeably. |\n| Inactive | x | The batch was successfully promoted, but has either been reverted or has expired. The batch will no longer be available for downstream consumption, but the underlying data will remain in Master until it has been retained, archived, or otherwise deleted. |\n| Loading | | The client is currently writing data for the batch. The batch is **not** ready for promotion, at this point in time. |\n| Loaded | | The client has completed writing data for the batch. The batch is ready for promotion. |\n| Retained | | The data has been taken out of Master, and in a designated archive in Adobe Data Lake. |\n| Staging | | The client has successfully signaled the batch for promotion, and the data is being staged for consumption downstream. |\n| Retrying | | The client has signaled the batch for promotion, but due to an error, the batch is being retried by a Batch Monitoring service. This state can be used to tell clients that there may be a delay in ingesting the data. |\n| Stalled | | The client has signaled the batch for promotion, but after `n` retries by a Batch Monitoring service, the batch promotion has stalled. |\n\n### What does \"Staging\" mean for batches?\n\nWhen a batch is in \"Staging\", it means that the batch was successfully signaled for promotion, and that the data is being staged for consumption downstream.\n\n### What does it mean when a batch is \"Retrying\"?\n\nWhen a batch is in \"Retrying\", it means that the batch's data ingestion has been temporarily halted due to intermittent issues. When this happens, it requires no customer intervention.\n\n### What does it mean when a batch is \"Stalled\"?\n\nWhen a batch is in \"Stalled\", it means that [!DNL Data Ingestion Services] is experiencing difficulty ingesting the batch and all retries have been exhausted. \n\n### What does it mean if a batch is still \"Loading\"?\n\nWhen a batch is in \"Loading\", it means that the CompleteBatch API has not been called to promote the batch. \n\n### Is there a way to know if a batch has been successfully ingested?\n\nOnce the batch status is \"Active\", the batch has been successfully ingested. To find out the status of the batch, follow the steps detailed [earlier](#how-is-batch-ingestion-monitored).\n\n### What happens after a batch fails?\n\nWhen a batch fails, the reason it fails can be identified in the `errors` section of the payload. Examples of errors can be seen below:\n\n```json\n    \"errors\":[\n        {\n            \"code\":\"106\",\n            \"description\":\"Dataset file is empty. Please upload file with data.\",\n            \"rows\":[]\n        },\n        {\n            \"code\":\"118\",\n            \"description\":\"CSV file contains empty header row.\",\n            \"rows\":[]\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\nOnce the errors have been corrected, the batch can be re-uploaded.\n\n## Batch Support\n\n### How should batches be deleted?\n\nInstead of deleting directly from [!DNL Catalog], batches should be removed using either method provided below:\n\n1. If the batch is in progress, the batch should be aborted.\n2. If the batch is successfully mastered, the batch should be reverted.\n\n### What batch-level metrics are available?\n\nThe following batch-level metrics are available for batches in the Active/Success state:\n\n| Metric | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| inputByteSize | The total number of bytes staged for [!DNL Data Ingestion Services] to process. |\n| inputRecordSize | The total number of rows staged for [!DNL Data Ingestion Services] to process. |\n| outputByteSize | The total number of bytes outputted by [!DNL Data Ingestion Services] to [!DNL Data Lake]. |\n| outputRecordSize | The total number of rows outputted by [!DNL Data Ingestion Services] to [!DNL Data Lake]. |\n| partitionCount | The total number of partitions written into [!DNL Data Lake]. |\n\n### Why are metrics not available on some batches?\n\nThere are two reasons that metrics may not be available on your batch:\n\n1. The batch never successfully made it to the Active/Success state.\n2. The batch was promoted using a legacy promotion path, such as CSV ingestion.\n\n### What do the different status codes mean?\n\n| Status Code | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| 106 | The dataset file is empty. |\n| 118 | The CSV file contains an empty header row. |\n| 200 | The batch has been accepted for processing, and will transition to a final state, such as Active or Failure. Once submitted, the batch can be monitored using the `GetBatch` endpoint. |\n| 400 | Bad Request. Returned if there are either missing or overlapping chunks in a batch. |\n\n[large-file-upload]: batch_data_ingestion_developer_guide.md#how-to-ingest-large-parquet-files\n",

Intelligent Services use Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas in order to achieve this.\nexl-id: 17bd7cc0-da86-4600-8290-cd07bdd5d262\n---\n# Prepare data for use in [!DNL Intelligent Services]\n\nIn order for [!DNL Intelligent Services] to discover insights from your marketing events data, the data must be semantically enriched and maintained in a standard structure. [!DNL Intelligent Services] leverage [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schemas in order to achieve this. Specifically, all datasets that are used in [!DNL Intelligent Services] must conform to the Consumer ExperienceEvent (CEE) XDM schema or use the Adobe Analytics connector. Additionally, Customer AI supports the Adobe Audience Manager connector.\n\nThis document provides general guidance on mapping your marketing events data from multiple channels to the CEE schema, outlining information on important fields within the schema to help you determine how to effectively map your data to its structure. If you plan on using Adobe Analytics data, please view the section for [Adobe Analytics data preparation](#analytics-data). If you plan on using Adobe Audience Manager data (Customer AI only), please view the section for [Adobe Audience Manger data preparation](#AAM-data).\n\n## Data Requirements\n\n[!DNL Intelligent Services] require different amounts of historical data depending on the goal you create. Regardless, the data you prepare for **all** [!DNL Intelligent Services] must include both positive and negative customer journeys / events. Having both negative and positive events improves model precision and accuracy. \n\nFor example, if you are using Customer AI to predict the propensity to buy a product, the model for Customer AI needs both examples of successful purchase paths and examples of unsuccessful paths. This is because during model training, Customer AI looks to understand what events and journeys lead to a purchase. This also includes the actions taken by customers who did not purchase, such as an individual who stopped their journey at adding an item to the cart. These customers may exhibit similar behaviors however, Customer AI can provide insights and drilldown the major differences and factors that lead to a higher propensity score. Similarly, Attribution AI requires both types of events and journeys in order to display metrics such as touchpoint effectiveness, top conversion paths, and breakdowns by touchpoint position.\n\nFor more examples and information on historical data requirements, visit the [Customer AI](./customer-ai/data-requirements.md#data-requirements) or [Attribution AI](./attribution-ai/input-output.md#data-requirements) historical data requirements section in the input / output documentation.\n\n### Guidelines for stitching data\n\nIt is recommend that you stitch the events of a user across a common id when possible. For example, you may have user data with \"id1\" across 10 events. Later, the same user deleted the cookie id and is recorded as \"id2\" across next 20 events. If you know that id1 and id2 correspond to same user, the best practice is to stitch all 30 events with a common id. \n\nIf this is not possible, you should treat each set of events as a different user when creating your model input data. This ensures the best results during model training and scoring.\n\n## Workflow summary\n\nThe preparation process varies depending on whether your data is stored in Adobe Experience Platform or externally. This section summarizes the necessary steps you need to take, given either scenario.\n\n### External data preparation\n\nIf your data is stored outside of Experience Platform, you need to map your data to the required and relevant fields in a [Consumer ExperienceEvent schema](#cee-schema). This schema can be augmented with custom field groups to better capture your customer data. Once mapped, you can create a dataset using your Consumer ExperienceEvent schema and [ingest your data to Platform](../ingestion/home.md). The CEE dataset can then be selected when configuring an [!DNL Intelligent Service].\n\nDepending on the [!DNL Intelligent Service] you wish to use, different fields may be required. Note that it is a best practice to add data to a field if you have the data available. To learn more about the required fields, visit the [Attribution AI](./attribution-ai/input-output.md) or [Customer AI](./customer-ai/data-requirements.md) data requirements guide.\n\n### Adobe Analytics data preparation {#analytics-data}\n\nCustomer AI and Attribution AI natively support Adobe Analytics data. To use Adobe Analytics data, follow the steps outlined in the documentation to set up an [Analytics source connector](../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/analytics.md). \n\nOnce the source connector is streaming your data into Experience Platform, you are able to select Adobe Analytics as a data source followed by a dataset during your instance configuration. All of the required schema field groups and individual fields are automatically created during the connection set up. You do not need to ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) the datasets into the CEE format.\n\nIf you compare the data flown through the Adobe Analytics source connector onto Adobe Experience Platform with Adobe Analytics data, you may notice some discrepancies. The Analytics Source connector might drop rows during the transformation to an Experience Data Model (XDM) schema. There can be multiple reasons for the whole row to be unfit for transformation which include missing timestamps, missing personIDs, invalid or large person IDs, invalid analytic values, and more.\n\nFor more information and examples, visit the documentation for [comparing Adobe Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics data](https://www.adobe.com/go/compare-aa-data-to-cja-data). This article is designed to help you diagnose and solve for those differences so that you and your team can use Adobe Experience Platform data for Intelligent Services unimpeded by concerns about data integrity.\n\nIn Adobe Experience Platform Query Services, run the following Total Records between start and end timestamp by channel.typeAtSource query to find the count by marketing channels.\n\n```SELECT channel.typeAtSource as typeAtSource, \n       Count(_id) AS Records \nFROM  df_hotel\nWHERE timestamp>=from_utc_timestamp('2021-05-15','UTC')\n        AND timestamp<from_utc_timestamp('2022-01-10','UTC')\n        AND timestamp IS NOT NULL\n        AND enduserids._experience.aaid.id IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY channel.typeAtSource\n```        \n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The Adobe Analytics connector takes up to four weeks to backfill data. If you recently set up a connection you should verify that the dataset has the minimum length of data required for Customer or Attribution AI. Please review the historical data sections in [Customer AI](./customer-ai/data-requirements.md#data-requirements) or [Attribution AI](./attribution-ai/input-output.md#data-requirements), and verify you have enough data for your prediction goal.\n\n### Adobe Audience Manager data preparation (Customer AI only) {#AAM-data}\n\nCustomer AI natively supports Adobe Audience Manager data. To use Audience Manager data, follow the steps outlined in the documentation to set up an [Audience Manager source connector](../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/audience-manager.md).\n\nOnce the source connector is streaming your data into Experience Platform, you are able to select Adobe Audience Manager as a data source followed by a dataset during your Customer AI configuration. All of the schema field groups and individual fields are automatically created during the connection set up. You do not need to ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) the datasets into the CEE format.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>If you recently set up a connector you should verify that the dataset has the minimum length of data required. Please review the historical data section in the [input/output documentation](./customer-ai/data-requirements.md) for Customer AI, and verify you have enough data for your prediction goal.\n\n### [!DNL Experience Platform] data preparation\n\nIf your data is already stored in [!DNL Platform] and not streaming through the Adobe Analytics or Adobe Audience Manager (Customer AI only) source connectors, follow the steps below. It is still recommended you understand the CEE schema.\n\n1. Review the structure of the [Consumer ExperienceEvent schema](#cee-schema) and determine whether your data can be mapped to its fields.\n2. Contact Adobe Consulting Services to help map your data to the schema and ingest it into [!DNL Intelligent Services], or [follow the steps in this guide](#mapping) if you want to map the data yourself.\n\n## Understanding the CEE schema {#cee-schema}\n\nThe Consumer ExperienceEvent schema describes the behavior of an individual as it relates to digital marketing events (web or mobile) as well as online or offline commerce activity. The use of this schema is required for [!DNL Intelligent Services] because of its semantically well-defined fields (columns), avoiding any unknown names that would otherwise make the data less clear.\n\nThe CEE schema, like all XDM ExperienceEvent schemas, captures the time-series-based state of the system when an event (or set of events) occurred, including the point in time and the identity of the subject involved. Experience Events are fact records of what occurred, and thus they are immutable and represent what happened without aggregation or interpretation.\n\n[!DNL Intelligent Services] utilize several key fields within this schema to generate insights from your marketing events data, all of which can be found at the root level and expanded to show their required subfields.\n\n![](./images/data-preparation/schema-expansion.gif)\n\nLike all XDM schemas, the CEE schema field group is extensible. In other words, additional fields can be added to the CEE field group, and different variations can be included in multiple schemas if necessary.\n\nA complete example of the field group can be found in the [public XDM repository](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/797cf4930d5a80799a095256302675b1362c9a15/docs/reference/context/experienceevent-consumer.schema.md). In addition, you can view and copy the following [JSON file](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-platform.en/blob/master/help/intelligent-services/assets/CEE_XDM_sample_rows.json) for an example of how data can be structured to comply with the CEE schema. Refer to both of these examples as you learn about the key fields outlined in the section below, in order to determine how you can map your own data to the schema.\n\n## Key fields\n\nThere are several key fields within the CEE field group which should be utilized in order for [!DNL Intelligent Services] to generate useful insights. This section describes the use case and expected data for these fields, and provides links to reference documentation for further examples.\n\n### Mandatory fields\n\nWhile the use of all key fields is strongly recommended, there are two fields that are **required** in order for [!DNL Intelligent Services] to work:\n\n* [A primary identity field](#identity)\n* [xdm:timestamp](#timestamp)\n* [xdm:channel](#channel) (mandatory only for Attribution AI)\n\n#### Primary identity {#identity}\n\nOne of the fields in your schema must be set as a primary identity field, which allows [!DNL Intelligent Services] to link each instance of time-series data to an individual person.\n\nYou must determine the best field to use as a primary identity based on the source and nature of your data. An identity field must include an **identity namespace** that indicates the type of identity data the field expects as a value. Some valid namespace values include:\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is also known as MCID and continues to be used in namespaces.\n\n* \"email\"\n* \"phone\"\n* \"mcid\" (for Adobe Audience Manager IDs)\n* \"aaid\" (for Adobe Analytics IDs)\n\nIf you are unsure which field you should use as a primary identity, contact Adobe Consulting Services to determine the best solution. If a primary identity is not set, the Intelligent Service application uses the following default behavior:\n\n| Default | Attribution AI | Customer AI |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Identity column | `endUserIDs._experience.aaid.id` | `endUserIDs._experience.mcid.id` |\n| Namespace | AAID | ECID |\n\nTo set a primary identity, navigate to your schema from the **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** tab and select the schema name hyperlink to open the **[!DNL Schema Editor]**.\n\n![Navigate to schema](./images/data-preparation/navigate_schema.png)\n\nNext, navigate to the field you wish to as a primary identity and select it. The **[!UICONTROL Field properties]** menu opens for that field.\n\n![Select the field](./images/data-preparation/find_field.png)\n\nIn the **[!UICONTROL Field properties]** menu, scroll down until you find the **[!UICONTROL Identity]** checkbox. After checking the box, the option to set the selected identity as the **[!UICONTROL Primary identity]** appears. Select this box as well.\n\n![Select checkbox](./images/data-preparation/set_primary_identity.png)\n\nNext, you must provide an **[!UICONTROL Identity namespace]** from the list of pre-defined namespaces in the dropdown. In this example, the ECID namesapce is selected since an Adobe Audience Manager ID `mcid.id` is being used. Select **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to confirm the updates then select **[!UICONTROL Save]** in the top-right corner to save the changes to your schema.\n\n![Save the changes](./images/data-preparation/select_namespace.png)\n\n#### xdm:timestamp {#timestamp}\n\nThis field represents the datetime at which the event occurred. This value must be provided as a string, as per the ISO 8601 standard.\n\n#### xdm:channel {#channel}\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This field is only mandatory when using Attribution AI.\n\nThis field represents the marketing channel related to the ExperienceEvent.

All historical data used in [!DNL Intelligent Services] must fall within the minimum time window of four months of data, plus the number of days intended as a lookback period.\n\nAfter deciding the range of data you want to send, contact Adobe Consulting Services to help map your data to the schema and ingest it into the service.\n\nIf you have an [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] subscription and want to map and ingest the data yourself, follow the steps outlined in the section below.\n\n### Using Adobe Experience Platform\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The steps below require a subscription to Experience Platform. If you do not have access to Platform, skip ahead to the [next steps](#next-steps) section.\n\nThis section outlines the workflow for mapping and ingesting data into Experience Platform for use in [!DNL Intelligent Services], including links to tutorials for detailed steps.\n\n#### Create a CEE schema and dataset\n\nWhen you are ready to start preparing your data for ingestion, the first step is to create a new XDM schema that employs the CEE field group. The following tutorials walk through the process of creating a new schema in the UI or API:\n\n* [Create a schema in the UI](../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md)\n* [Create a schema in the API](../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-api.md)\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The tutorials above follow a generic workflow for creating a schema. When choosing a class for the schema, you must use the **XDM ExperienceEvent class**. Once this class has been chosen, you can then add the CEE field group to the schema.\n\nAfter adding the CEE field group to the schema, you can add other field groups as required for additional fields within your data.\n\nOnce you have created and saved the schema, you can create a new dataset based on that schema. The following tutorials walk through the process of creating a new dataset in the UI or API:\n\n* [Create a dataset in the UI](../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#create) (Follow the workflow for using an existing schema)\n* [Create a dataset in the API](../catalog/datasets/create.md)\n\nAfter the dataset is created, you can find it in the Platform UI within the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** workspace.\n\n![](images/data-preparation/dataset-location.png)\n\n#### Add identity fields to the dataset\n\nIf you are bringing in data from [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager], [!DNL Adobe Analytics], or another external source, then you have the option to set a schema field as an identity field. To set a schema field as an identity field, view the section on setting identity fields within the [UI tutorial](../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md#identity-field) or [API tutorial](../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-api.md#define-an-identity-descriptor) for creating a schema.\n\nIf you are ingesting data from a local CSV file, you can skip ahead to the next section on [mapping and ingesting data](#ingest).\n\n#### Map and ingest data {#ingest}\n\nAfter creating a CEE schema and dataset, you can start mapping your data tables to the schema and ingest that data into Platform. See the tutorial on [mapping a CSV file to an XDM schema](../ingestion/tutorials/map-csv/overview.md) for steps on how to perform this in the UI. You can use the following [sample JSON file](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-platform.en/blob/master/help/intelligent-services/assets/CEE_XDM_sample_rows.json) to test the ingestion process before using your own data.\n\nOnce a dataset has been populated, the same dataset can be used to ingest additional data files.\n\nIf your data is stored in a supported third-party application, you can also choose to create a [source connector](../sources/home.md) to ingest your marketing events data into [!DNL Platform] in real time.\n\n## Next steps {#next-steps}\n\nThis document provided general guidance on preparing your data for use in [!DNL Intelligent Services]. If you require additional consulting based on your use case, please contact Adobe Consulting Support.\n\nOnce you have successfully populated a dataset with your customer experience data, you can use [!DNL Intelligent Services] to generate insights.

The product profile you assign to an API integration determines what permissions that integration has when accessing Privacy Service capabilities. See the guide on [managing Privacy Service permissions](../permissions.md) for more information.\n\n## Gather values for required headers\n\nIn order to make calls to the Privacy Service API, you must first gather your access credentials to be used in required headers:\n\n* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`\n* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`\n* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}`\n\nThese values are generated using [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console). Your `{ORG_ID}` and `{API_KEY}` only need to be generated once and can be reused in future API calls. However, your `{ACCESS_TOKEN}` is temporary and must be regenerated every 24 hours.\n\nThe steps for generating these values are covered in detail below.\n\n### One-time setup\n\nGo to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) and sign in with your Adobe ID. Next, follow the steps outlined in the tutorial on [creating an empty project](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-empty/) in the Developer Console documentation.\n\nOnce you have created a new project, select **[!UICONTROL Add to Project]** and choose **[!UICONTROL API]** from the dropdown menu.\n\n![The API option being selected from the [!UICONTROL Add to Project] dropdown from the project details page in Developer Console](../images/api/getting-started/add-api-button.png)\n\n#### Select an API and generate a keypair {#keypair}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Add an API]** screen appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Experience Cloud]** to narrow the list of available APIs, then select the card for **[!UICONTROL Privacy Service API]** before selecting **[!UICONTROL Next]**.\n\n![The Privacy Service API card being selected from the list of available APIs](../images/api/getting-started/add-privacy-service-api.png)\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Configure API]** screen appears. Select the option to **[!UICONTROL Generate a key pair]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Generate keypair]**.\n\n![The [!UICONTROL Generate a key pair] option being selected on the [!UICONTROL Configure API] screen](../images/api/getting-started/generate-key-pair.png)\n\nThe key pair is automatically generated and a ZIP file containing a private key and a public certificate are downloaded by your browser (to be used in a later step). Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to continue.\n\n![The generated keypair shown in the UI, whose values are automatically downloaded by the browser](../images/api/getting-started/key-pair-generated.png)\n\n#### Assign permissions through product profiles {#product-profiles}\n\nThe final configuration step is to select the product profiles that this integration will inherit its permissions from. If you select more than one profile, their permission sets will be combined for the integration.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Product profiles and the granular permissions they provide are created and managed by administrators through Adobe Admin Console. See the guide on [Privacy Service permissions](../permissions.md) for more information.\n\nWhen finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save configured API]**.\n\n![A single product profile being selected from the list before saving the configuration](../images/api/getting-started/select-product-profiles.png)\n\nOnce the API has been added to the project, the project page reappears on the **Privacy Service API overview** page. From here, scroll down to the **[!UICONTROL Service Account (JWT)]** section, which provides the following access credentials that are required in all calls to the Privacy Service API:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL CLIENT ID]**: The Client ID is the required `{API_KEY}` that must be provided in the `x-api-key` header.\n* **[!UICONTROL ORGANIZATION ID]**: The Organization ID is the `{ORG_ID}` value that must be used in the `x-gw-ims-org-id` header.\n\n![The Client ID and Organization ID values as they appear on the project overview page after the API has been configured](../images/api/getting-started/jwt-credentials.png)\n\n### Authentication for each session\n\nThe final required credential you must gather is your `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`, which is used in the Authorization header. Unlike the values for `{API_KEY}` and `{ORG_ID}`, a new token must be generated every 24 hours to continue using the API.\n\nIn general, there are two methods of generating an access token:\n\n* [Generate the token manually](#manual-token) for testing and development.\n* [Automate token generation](#auto-token) for API integrations.\n\n#### Generate a token manually {#manual-token}\n\nTo manually generate a new `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`, open the previously downloaded private key and paste its contents into the text box beside **[!UICONTROL Generate access token]** before selecting **[!UICONTROL Generate Token]**.\n\n![The previously generated access token being pasted on the project's overview page, with the [!UICONTROL Generate Token] button being selected after](../images/api/getting-started/paste-private-key.png)\n\nA new access token is generated, and a button to copy the token to your clipboard is provided. This value is used for the required Authorization header, and must be provided in the format `Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`.\n\n![The generated access token being copied from the UI](../images/api/getting-started/generated-access-token.png)\n\n#### Automate token generation {#auto-token}\n\nYou can generate new access tokens for automated processes by sending a JSON Web Token (JWT) through a POST request to Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS). See the Developer Console document on [JWT authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/JWT/) for detailed steps.\n\n## Reading sample API calls\n\nEach endpoint guide provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/api-guide.md#sample-api) in the getting started guide for Platform APIs.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you understand what headers to use, you are ready to begin making calls to the Privacy Service API. Select one of the endpoint guides to get started:\n\n* [Privacy jobs](./privacy-jobs.md)\n* [Consent](./consent.md)\n",

Access to individual objects, such as schema fields and segments, can be granted/denied with policies based on the object's attributes and role. This feature lets you grant or revoke access to individual objects for specific Platform users in your organization.\n\nThis functionality allows you to categorize schema fields, segments, and so on with labels that define organizational or data usage scopes. You can apply these same labels to journeys, Offers, and other objects in Adobe Journey Optimizer. In parallel, administrators can define access policies surrounding Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields and better manage which users or groups (internal, external, or third-party users) can access those fields.\n\n[!NOTE]\n\nThis document focuses on the use case of access control policies. If you are trying to set up policies to govern the use of data rather than which Platform users have access to it, see the end-to-end guide on data governance instead.\n\nGetting started\nThis tutorial requires a working understanding of the following Platform components:\n\n[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System: The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.\n\nBasics of schema composition: Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.\n\nSchema Editor tutorial: Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.\n\nAdobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service: The segmentation engine within [!DNL Platform] used to create audience segments from your customer profiles based on customer behaviors and attributes.\n\nUse case overview\nYou will go through an example attribute-based access control workflow where you will create and assign roles, labels, and policies to configure whether your users can or cannot access specific resources in your organization. This guide uses an example of restricting access to sensitive data to demonstrate the workflow. This use case is outlined below:\n\nYou are a healthcare provider and want to configure access to resources in your organization.\n\nYour internal marketing team should be able to access [!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data] data.\n\nYour external agency should not be able to access [!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data] data.\n\nIn order to do this, you must configure roles, resources, and policies.\n\nYou will:\n\nLabel the roles for your users: Use the example of a healthcare provider (ACME Business Group) whose marketing group works with external agencies.\n\nLabel your resources (schema fields and segments): Assign the [!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data] label to schema resources and segments.\n\nActivate the policy that will link them together: : Enable the default policy to prevent access to schema fields and segments by connecting the labels on your resources to the labels in your role. Users with matching labels will then be given access to the schema field and segment across all sandboxes.\n\nPermissions\n[!UICONTROL Permissions] is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and policies to manage permissions for features and objects within a product application.\n\nThrough [!UICONTROL Permissions], you can create and manage roles and assign the desired resource permissions for these roles. [!UICONTROL Permissions] also allow you to manage the labels, sandboxes, and users associated with a specific role.\n\nContact your system administrator to gain access if you do not have admin privileges.\n\nOnce you have admin privileges, go to Adobe Experience Cloud and sign in using your Adobe credentials. Once logged in, the [!UICONTROL Overview] page appears for your organization you have admin privileges for. This page shows the products your organization is subscribed to, along with other controls to add users and admins to the organization. Select [!UICONTROL Permissions] to open the workspace for your Platform integration.\n\nImage showing the Permissions product being selected in Adobe Experience Cloud\n\nThe Permissions workspace for Platform UI appears, opening on the [!UICONTROL Roles] page.\n\nApply labels to a role {#label-roles}\n[!CONTEXTUALHELP]id=\"platform_permissions_labels_about\"title=\"What are labels?\"abstract=\"Labels allow you to categorize datasets and fields according to usage policies that apply to that data. Platform provides several Adobe-define \"core\" data usage labels, which cover a wide variety of common restrictions applicable to data governance. For example, Sensitive \"S\" labels such as RHD (Regulated Health Data) allow you to categorize data that refers to Protected Health Information (PHI). You can also define your own custom labels that fit your organization's needs.\"additional-url=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/labels/overview.html?lang=en#understanding-data-usage-labels\" text=\"Data usage labels overview\"\n\n[!CONTEXTUALHELP]id=\"platform_permissions_labels_about_create\"title=\"Create new label\"abstract=\"You can create your own custom labels to fit the needs of your organization.

For example, you can create a role for an Internal Marketing Team and apply the RHD label to that role, allowing your Internal Marketing Team to access Protected Health Information (PHI). Alternatively, you can also create a role for an External Agency and deny that role access to PHI data by not applying the RHD label to that role.\"additional-url=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/access-control/abac/permissions-ui/roles.html?lang=en#create-a-new-role\" text=\"Create a new role\"\n\n[!CONTEXTUALHELP]id=\"platform_permissions_roles_details\"title=\"Role overview\"abstract=\"The role overview dialog displays the resources and sandboxes that a given role is permitted to access.\"\n\nRoles are ways to categorize the types of users interacting with your Platform instance and are building blocks of access control policies.

Select [!UICONTROL RHD] to add the label for [!UICONTROL PHI/Regulated Health Data]. Allow for a few moments for a blue check mark to appear beside the label, and then select [!UICONTROL Save].\n\nImage showing the RHD label being selected and saved\n\n[!NOTE]\n\nWhen adding an organization group to a role, all users in that group will be added to the role. Any changes to the organization group (users removed or added) will be automatically updated within the role.\n\nApply labels to schema fields {#label-resources}\nNow that you have configured a user role with the [!UICONTROL RHD] label, the next step is to add that same label to the resources that you want to control for that role.\n\nSelect [!UICONTROL Schemas] from the left navigation and then select [!UICONTROL ACME Healthcare] from the list of schemas that appear.\n\nImage showing the ACME Healthcare schema being selected from the Schemas tab\n\nNext, select [!UICONTROL Labels] to see a list that displays the fields associated with your schema. From here, you can assign labels to one or multiple fields at once.

For this use case, select the [!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data] label, then select [!UICONTROL Save].\n\nImage showing the RHD label being selected and saved\n\n[!NOTE]\n\nWhen a label is added to a field, that label is applied to the parent resource of that field (either a class or a field group). If the parent class or field group is employed by other schemas, those schemas will inherit the same label.\n\nApply labels to segments\nOnce you have completed labeling your schema fields, you can now begin labeling your segments.\n\nSelect [!UICONTROL Segments] from the left navigation. A list of segments available in your organization is displayed. In this example, the following two segments are to be labeled as they contain sensitive health data:\n\nBlood Glucose >100\n\nInsulin <50\n\nSelect [!UICONTROL Blood Glucose >100] to start labeling the segment.\n\nImage showing the Blood Glucose >100 being selected from the Segments tab\n\nThe segment [!UICONTROL Details] screen appears. Select [!UICONTROL Manage Access].\n\nImage showing the selection of Manages access\n\nThe [!UICONTROL Edit labels] dialog appears, allowing you to choose the labels that you want to apply to the segment.

Follow this guide to learn how to perform key operations using the API.\\\nexl-id: 0fc32354-4869-4392-9501-b1dbea1bc55e\\\n---\\\n# Attribute-based access control API guide\\\n\\\nAttribute-based access control is a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that enables administrators to control access to specific objects and/or capabilities based on attributes. Attributes can be metadata added to an object, such as a label added to a schema field or segment. An administrator defines access policies that include attributes to manage user access permissions.\\\n\\\nThe attribute-based access control API is used to access roles, products, permission categories, and permission sets within Adobe Experience Platform, providing a user interface and RESTful API from which all available library resources are accessible.\\\n\\\n>[!IMPORTANT]\\\n>\\\n>Attribute-based access control is not to be confused with Experience Platform's data governance capabilities, which allow you to use labels and policies to control how data is used in Platform rather than which users in your organization have access to it. See the [Policy Service API guide](../../../data-governance/api/overview.md) for steps on how to programmatically leverage these capabilities.\\\n\\\nThese endpoints are outlined below. Please visit the individual endpoint guides for details and refer to the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for important information on required headers, reading sample API calls, and more.\\\n\\\n## Roles\\\n\\\nRoles define the access that an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user has to resources in your organization. In a role-based access control environment, user access provisioning is group through common responsibilities and needs. A role has a given set of permissions and members of your organization can be assigned to one or more roles, depending on the scope of view or write access they need. See the [roles endpoint guide](./roles.md) for more information on working with roles in the API.\\\n\\\n## Policies\\\n\\\nPolicies are statements that bring attributes together to establish permissible and impermissible actions. Policies can either be local or global, and can override other policies. The `/policies` endpoint allows you to programmatically manage policies in your organization. See the [policies endpoint guide](./policies.md) for more information on working with policies in the API.\\\n\\\n## Products\\\n\\\nThe `/products` endpoint in the attribute-based access control API allows you to programmatically manage products as well as permission categories and permission sets associated with products in your organization. See the [products endpoint guide](./products.md) for more information on working with products and their corresponding permission categories and permission sets in the API.\\\n\\\n## Next steps\\\n\\\nTo begin making calls using the attribute-based access control API, read the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) then select one of the endpoint guides to learn how to use specific endpoints.}",

The following sections provide additional information that developers will need to know in order to successfully make calls to the Schema Registry API.\\\nexl-id: 6fd956fb-ade4-48d3-843f-4c9a605945c9\\\n---\\\n# [!DNL Access Control] API guide\\\n\\\n[!DNL Access control] for [!DNL Experience Platform] is administered through the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com). This functionality leverages product profiles in Admin Console, which link users with permissions and sandboxes. See the [access control overview](../home.md) for more information.\\\n\\\nThis developer guide provides information on how to format your requests to the [[!DNL Access Control API]](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/access-control/), and covers the following operations:\\\n\\\n- [List names of permissions and resource types](./permissions-and-resource-types.md)\\\n- [View effective access policies for the current user](./effective-policies.md)\\\n\\\n## Getting started\\\n\\\nThe following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully make calls to the [!DNL Access Control] API.\\\n\\\n### Reading sample API calls\\\n\\\nThis guide provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.\\\n\\\n### Gather values for required headers\\\n\\\nIn order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:\\\n\\\n- Authorization: Bearer `\\{ACCESS_TOKEN\\}`\\\n- x-api-key: `\\{API_KEY\\}`\\\n- x-gw-ims-org-id: `\\{ORG_ID\\}`\\\n\\\nAll resources in [!DNL Experience Platform] are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:\\\n\\\n- x-sandbox-name: `\\{SANDBOX_NAME\\}`\\\n\\\n>[!NOTE]\\\n>\\\n>For more information on sandboxes in [!DNL Platform], see the [sandbox overview documentation](../../sandboxes/home.md).\\\n\\\nAll requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional header:\\\n\\\n- Content-Type: application/json\\\n\\\n## Next steps\\\n\\\nNow that you have gathered the required credentials, you can now continue to read the rest of the developer guide. Each section provides important information regarding their endpoints and demonstrate example API calls for performing CRUD operations. Each call includes the general API format, a sample request showing required headers and properly formatted payloads, and a sample response for a successful call.}",

This document outlines custom accessibility solutions within the Experience Platform user interface.\\\n\\\n## Homepage and UI overview\\\n\\\nThe Experience Platform user interface meets required contrast ratios for normal text, graphics, and UI components. The colors of the user interface have also been chosen to support accessibility for all users, including those with visual disabilities. \\\n\\\nIn Platform, UI elements that are clickable or actionable with a pointer can also be engaged using a keyboard. This includes the left navigation, video players, tables, and more.\\\n\\\nExperience Platform strives to meet international accessibility standards, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level A and Level AA and the Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) web standards.\\\n\\\n![The homepage of the Adobe Experience Platform UI.](images/homepage.png)\\\n\\\n## Left navigation\\\n\\\nThe left navigation within the Experience Platform UI is keyboard-accessible and provides color contrast in normal, hover, and selection states that meet accessibility standards.\\\n\\\nFrom the Home screen, users can tab into the left navigation. Selecting **Shift + Tab** returns the user to the Home screen. \\\n\\\n![The Experience Platform left navigation.](images/left-navigation-select.png)\\\n\\\nWith the left navigation in focus, **Tab** takes users to the expand and collapse interaction. The ability to expand or collapse the left navigation is activated with **Enter (Return)**.\\\n\\\n![The Experience Platform left navigation collapsed.](images/left-navigation-collapse.png)\\\n\\\nWith the left navigation in focus, up and down arrow keys navigate to each item in the navigation and cycle continuously (in other words, the focus does not shift away until the user tabs away from the left navigation). Focus is shown for navigation items when selected. The current selection is shown with a highlight and bolded text. When selecting a left navigation item, **Enter (Return)** opens the selected UI item in the right panel, however focus remains in left-navigation until the user tabs away.\\\n\\\n![The Experience Platform left navigation with Sources selected.](images/left-navigation-sources.png)\\\n\\\nSome features within Platform are not enabled for all users. These items appear in the navigation but are not able to be selected. When navigating with a keyboard, these items are skipped during arrow navigation and cannot be selected using **Enter (Return)**.\\\n\\\n![Sections of the Experience Platform left navigation that are not enabled for the user are not able to be selected.](images/left-navigation-sections-disabled.png)\\\n\\\n## Embedded video dialog\\\n\\\nVideos can be viewed within Experience Platform by using keyboard navigation to highlight and select an available video link. This opens an embedded video dialog within the Platform UI.\\\n\\\n![A blue border appearing around a selected element to indicate that focus is applied.](images/profile-overview-tab.png)\\\n\\\n## Video dialog keyboard accessibility\\\n\\\nThe embedded video dialog can also be navigated using the keyboard. The following table outlines the complete keyboard navigation available for the embedded video dialog.\\\n\\\n|Dialog Element|Keyboard accessibility|Description|\\\n|---|---|---|\\\n|Play & Pause|Tab<br/>Spacebar|Use **Tab** to set focus on play button. **Spacebar** begins video playback and pauses video playback.|\\\n|Scrubber|Tab<br/>Left arrow<br/>Right arrow|When video is playing, use **Tab** to focus scrubber. With the scrubber in focus, **left and right arrow keys** skip video playback ahead and back 5 seconds, respectively.|\\\n|Mute|Tab<br/>Spacebar|Use **Tab** to focus the mute volume element. Use **spacebar** to mute or unmute video playback.|\\\n|Volume|Tab<br/>Left arrow<br/>Right arrow|Use **Tab** to focus on volume element. **Left and right arrow keys** move volume up and down, respectively.|\\\n|[!UICONTROL Closed Captions] (\"cc\")|Tab<br/>Enter<br/>Up arrow<br/>Down arrow|**Tab** to [!UICONTROL Closed Captions] (\"cc\") element. Use **Enter** to open the menu, and **up and down arrow keys** to select a language for captions. **Enter** confirms your selection.|\\\n|[!UICONTROL Quality]|Tab<br/>Enter<br/>Up arrow<br/>Down arrow|Use **Tab** to focus the [!UICONTROL Quality] element. Use **Enter** to open the menu and the **up and down arrow keys** to select video quality. **Enter** confirms your selection.|\\\n|Full-screen|Tab<br/>Spacebar or Enter<br/>Escape|Use **Tab** to focus the full-screen element. Use **spacebar or Enter** to activate full-screen view. **Escape** (\"esc\") exits full-screen mode.|\\\n|Close|Tab<br/>Spacebar or Enter|Use **Tab** to focus the close button. Use **spacebar or Enter** key to exit the video dialog.|\\\n\\\n>[!NOTE]\\\n>\\\n>At any time during playback, the escape (\"esc\") key can be used to close the embedded video dialog.\\\n\\\n![The embedded video dialog with numbers identifying keyboard navigation elements.](images/video-dialog.png)\\\n\\\n## File drag and drop\\\n\\\nIn Experience Platform, all file selection drag-and-drop zones are keyboard-accessible. Using **Tab** to highlight **[!UICONTROL Choose files]** and using **Enter or spacebar** to select it invokes the operating system's file selection UI.\\\n\\\nAfter a file has been uploaded, a delete icon becomes keyboard-navigable to remove the selected file and upload a new one. Users can use **Tab** to focus on the delete icon and **Enter or spacebar** to select it. Once the file is removed, **[!UICONTROL Choose files]** is automatically in focus and able to be selected.\\\n\\\nAlternatively, if the file that is uploaded is not in the correct format, an error icon is displayed along with an error message and the **[!UICONTROL Choose files]** button is in focus and selectable.\\\n\\\n![A file drag-and-drop zone with an error message and the choose files button in focus.](images/drag-and-drop.png)\\\n\\\nUsing a mouse to select the drag-and-drop zone also invokes the file selection UI, or a mouse user can select a file and drag onto the zone to begin uploading.\\\n\\\n![A file drag-and-drop zone in focus as a mouse user drags a file into the zone.](images/drag-and-drop-mouse-over.png)\\\n\\\n## Table browse\\\n\\\nAll tables within the Experience Platform user interface are keyboard-accessible. Browsing and interacting with table rows and columns is possible through a series of keyboard shortcuts:\\\n\\\n* From the table header, use the **down arrow** to browse the table. Table headers are selectable when navigating via **Tab**, and you can change the sorting order using **spacebar**.\\\n* **Up and down arrow keys** moves up and down through the rows in the table.\\\n* When a row is selected or in focus, using **Enter** on the row provides details in the right rail.\\\n* When a row is selected or in focus, use **arrow keys** to move through each item in the row.\\\n* Use **Enter** to select an item in the row. Users with screen readers are alerted if a new window must open.\\\n* When you zoom to 200% or more, you can see the **rail inspector** icon as the right rail collapses to provide more viewing space for the table.\\\n\\\n![The rail inspector icon in focus when a user zooms to 200%.](images/rail-inspector.png)\\\n\\\n### Browse table keyboard accessibility\\\n\\\n|Keyboard accessibility|Description|\\\n|---|---|\\\n|HOME (Function + left arrow)|When row focused, takes users to the first item in the row|\\\n|END (Function + right arrow)|When row focused, takes users to the last item in the row|\\\n|Page up|Traverses 10 rows up in the table (per page)|\\\n|Page down|Traverses 10 rows down in the table (per page)|\\\n|Control + HOME|Goes to first row in table|\\\n|Control + END|Goes to first wor in table per page|\\\n\\\n## Schema Editor UI\\\n\\\nThe Schema Editor UI is made accessible by the following functionality:\\\n\\\n* The Schema Editor supports keyboard navigation, including use of **Tab** to navigation through UI elements.\\\n* **Tab** enters the search field, then into the schema tree.\\\n* Schema tree supports the use of arrow keys to navigate through the schema tree UI\\\n  * **Up and down arrows** can be used to traverse the tree.\\\n  * **Left and right arrows** can be used to expand and collapse nodes or move between inline actions on the schema tree.\\\n* **Enter (Return)** activates individual node details in the detail panel on the right.\\\n* The **Home** key returns to the top of the tree.\\\n* The **End** key navigates to the bottom of the tree.\\\n* The schema tree also includes ARIA labels for screen readers.\\\n\\\n## Segment Builder UI\\\n\\\nWhen using the Segment Builder UI to create, edit, and interact with segments within Experience Platform, the following features improve accessibility:\\\n\\\n* The Segment Builder UI is accessible via keyboard navigation.\\\n* Screen readers should recognize markup tags for headings and can announce the heading along with its level.\\\n* Other assistive technologies can change the visual display of a page, using properly coded headings to display an outline or alternate view.\\\n\\\nYou can now collapse or expand the left and right rails of the segment builder canvas to gain more screen space. This feature is particularly helpful as it offers full function capability at 200% zoom. \\\n\\\n![The segment builder canvas with the left and right rail disclosure widgets highlighted.](images/left-right-rail-expandables.png)\\\n\\\n## Query Service Editor\\\n\\\nThe following accessibility features are available in the Query Service editor:\\\n\\\n* Color contrast in the Query Service editor UI meets accessibility compliance.\\\n* Keyboard navigation is supported outside of the editor UI. The editor UI is an embedded Code Mirror.\\\n\\\n## System View tab in Sources and Destinations\\\n\\\nWhen browsing the **[!UICONTROL System View]** in Sources and Destinations, the following functionality improves accessibility:\\\n\\\n* **Tab** sets focus on the first source connection card\\\n  * **Tab** again to focus on the button inside of the card\\\n  * Select **Enter** to activate the call to action button inside the card\\\n* Selecting **Enter** on the connection card also activates more details in the right rail\\\n  * When the right rail is activated, focus is set to that area. **Tab** focuses on **Close** for the right rail pane. Selecting **Tab** again moves the focus through the right-rail panel\\\n  * If there is more than one source connection card, **Tab** moves through the connections\\\n  * Use **arrow keys (up, down, left, and right)** to move through the list of sources\\\n  * Select **Tab** to set focus on the right-rail panel}",

This document outlines the general accessibility features supported by Platform, including keyboard navigation, semantic structure, sufficient contrast between foreground elements and background elements, and support for assistive technologies.\\\n\\\n## Assistive technologies\\\n\\\nUsers with disabilities frequently rely on hardware and software, known as assistive technologies, to access digital content and to use software products. Adobe Experience Platform supports several types of assistive technologies (AT) such as screen readers, zoom, and voice recognition software by following accessibility best practices such as using semantic code, text equivalents, labels, and ARIA where needed. Interactive elements within the Experience Platform user interface (UI) use corresponding labels, accessible names, and roles that identify both their purpose and their current state. This ensures that assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can read out the labels and other information to users so that they can easily interact with the application controls.\\\n\\\n## Keyboard accessibility\\\n\\\nExperience Platform strives to support full keyboard accessibility.\\\n\\\nThe following navigational elements facilitate accessibility: \\\n* The Tab key moves between UI elements, sections, and menu groups.\\\n* Arrow keys move within menu groups to set focus to individual active elements. \\\n* Shift + Tab moves backwards through the tab order. \\\n* The Return (Enter) and Spacebar keys activate selected items. \\\n* The escape key (ESC) acts as a cancel button to close a dialog when present.\\\n* Experience Platform displays a blue border around a selected element to display a clear indication of which UI element currently has focus. \\\n\\\n![A blue border appearing around a selected element to indicate that focus is applied.](images/profile-overview-tab.png)\\\n\\\n## Color palettes & contrast\\\n\\\nExperience Platform strives for [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) conformance, including requirements for color contrast. The Experience Platform UI provides enough contrast in the application to ensure an accessible viewing experience for users with low vision or color deficiencies.\\\n\\\n![The color palette and contrast present on the homepage of the Experience Platform UI.](images/homepage.png)\\\n\\\n## Required field validation\\\n\\\nWhen adding data, creating schemas, or defining segments, required fields are indicated both visually, using an asterisk next to the text label of a field, and programmatically. These fields trigger validation when you enter invalid data in fields and upon saving. If a required field does not pass validation, it is outlined in red with an error icon and a written description of the issue that needs to be fixed also appears.\\\n\\\n![A close up of a required field that has not passed validation. The field appears in red and an error icon is present.](images/field-validation.png)}",

If you would like to leave feedback, please do so by selecting the button at the top of the Tags admin page.\\\n\\\nTags are a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that enables administrators to manage metadata taxonomies in order to classify business objects for easier discovery and categorization. Tags are metadata that can be thought of as keywords that can be attached to a segment, dataset, journey, or other objects to enable searches to find that object and related objects. Tags are classified into two types: categorized and uncategorized.\\\n\\\nIn order to provide more context and define the purpose of a tag, categories organize tags into useful sets. An administrator defines which categorized tags are available for users to add to objects. New tags that don't contain categories can also be created in-line in workflows where tags are applied. These tags will show up in the uncategorized section of the tag inventory. Tags can be applied by admins and users alike, regardless of who created them. All types of tags are available for selection when assigning to an object, searching, or filtering.\\\n\\\n## Tags terminology\\\n\\\nTagging involves the following components:\\\n\\\n| Terminology | Definition |\\\n| --- | --- |\\\n| Archived | A state for a tag that keeps current associations with objects but restricts the tag from being applied to further objects.  Archived tags are hidden from the tag picker. |\\\n| Object | An Experience Cloud item that can have a tag applied.  Examples: Segment, Journey, Dataset. |\\\n| Tag | Tags are metadata and may be thought of as keywords that can be attached to a segment, dataset, journey, or other objects to enable searches to find that object and related objects. |\\\n| Tag Category | Tag Categories group tags into meaningful sets to provide greater context or describe the purpose of the tag.  Administrators manage tag categories and tags within categories. | \\\n| Uncategorized Tag | A new tag that is created in-line where tags are applied. These tags can be created and applied by any user, but they are not bound to a category.  Administrators may move these tags to a category to align with other similar tags. |\\\n\\\n## Tags inventory\\\n\\\nTag category and tag management using the tags inventory is available within the Experience Platform and Journey Optimizer navigation. Changes to tags in the inventory are reflected in all objects that support tags. All users are able to access and browse the tags inventory, but tag management is limited to system and product admins.\\\n\\\nThe tags inventory has three levels of hierarchy, allowing users to manage tag categories, tags within a category, and individual tags. When managing an individual tag, users can view and navigate to any object where that tag is currently applied.\\\n\\\n### Tags categories\\\n\\\nCategories group tags into meaningful sets to provide greater context or describe the purpose of the tag. On any tag with a category, the category name followed by a colon precedes the tag name.\\\n\\\nThe following actions are possible when using tag categories:\\\n\\\n* [Create tag category](./ui/tags-categories.md#create-tag-category)\\\n* [Edit tag category](./ui/tags-categories.md#edit-tag-category-edit-tag-category)\\\n* [Delete tag category](./ui/tags-categories.md#delete-tag-category-delete-tag-category)\\\n\\\n### Managing Tags within a category\\\n\\\n>[!NOTE]\\\n>\\\n>In order to manage tags for Experience Cloud, you must be a system administrator or a product administrator for Adobe Experience Platform for your organization, which has a subscription to Experience Cloud.\\\n\\\nWithin a category (or the default \"Uncategorized\" group), you can create and manage tags. The following actions are possible when managing tags:\\\n\\\n* [Create a tag](./ui/managing-tags.md#create-a-tag-create-tag)\\\n* [Edit a tag](./ui/managing-tags.md#edit-a-tag-edit-tag)\\\n* [Move a tag between categories](./ui/managing-tags.md#move-a-tag-between-categories-move-tag)\\\n* [Archive a tag](./ui/managing-tags.md#archive-a-tag-archive-tag)\\\n* [Restore an archived tag](./ui/managing-tags.md#restore-an-archived-tag-restore-archived-tag)\\\n* [Delete a tag](./ui/managing-tags.md#delete-a-tag-delete-tag)\\\n* [View tagged objects](./ui/managing-tags.md#viewing-tagged-objects-view-tagged)}",

This data may be subject to usage restrictions defined by your organization or by legal regulations. Therefore, it is important to ensure that Real-Time CDP is compliant with usage policies when handling your data.\n\nAdobe Experience Platform Data Governance allows you to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data use. It plays a key role within Real-Time CDP, allowing you to define usage policies, categorize your data based on those policies, and check for policy violations when performing certain marketing actions.\n\nReal-Time CDP is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, and therefore the majority of Data Governance capabilities are covered in the [!DNL Experience Platform] documentation. This document is intended to complement the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) for [!DNL Experience Platform], and outlines the Governance features that are available in Real-Time CDP. The following topics are covered:\n\n* [Apply usage labels to your data](#labels)\n* [Manage data usage policies](#policies)\n* [Enforce data usage compliance](#enforce)\n\n## Apply usage labels to your data {#labels}\n\nData Governance allows you to apply usage labels to your data, either at the dataset or dataset-field level. Data usage labels allow you to categorize data according to usage policies that apply to that data. \n\nFor detailed information on working with data usage labels, see the [data usage labels user guide](../../data-governance/labels/overview.md) for Adobe Experience Platform.\n\n## Configure marketing actions for destinations {#destinations}\n\nYou can set data usage restrictions on a destination by defining marketing actions (also called marketing use cases) for that destination. A marketing action for a destination indicates the intent of the data that will be exported to that destination.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For more information on marketing actions and their use in data usage policies, see the [data usage policies overview](../../data-governance/policies/overview.md) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] documentation.\n\nDefining marketing actions on destinations allows you to ensure that any profiles or segments sent to those destinations are compliant with data usage policies. You should therefore add appropriate marketing actions to your destinations based on your organization's needs to enforce policy restrictions on activation.\n\nMarketing actions can only be selected when setting up a destination for the first time. Depending on the type of destination you are working with, the opportunity to configure marketing actions will appear at different points in the setup workflow. See the [destinations documentation](../destinations/overview.md) for steps on how to configure your particular destination.\n\n## Manage data usage policies {#policies}\n\nIn order for data usage labels to effectively support data compliance, data usage policies must be defined and enabled. Data usage policies are rules that describe the kinds of marketing actions that you are allowed to, or restricted from, performing on data within Real-Time CDP. See the \"Data usage policies\" section in the [!DNL Experience Platform] [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) for more information.\n\nAdobe Experience Platform provides several core policies for common customer experience use cases. These policies can be viewed in the UI by navigating to the **[!UICONTROL Policies]** workspace and selecting the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab. See the [policies user guide](../../data-governance/policies/user-guide.md) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] documentation for more detailed steps on working with policies in the UI, including how to make your own custom policies.\n\n## Enforce data usage compliance {#enforce}\n\nOnce data is labeled and usage policies are defined, you can enforce data usage compliance with policies. When activating audience segments to destinations in Real-Time CDP, Data Governance automatically enforces usage policies should any violations occur.\n\nSee the document on [automatic policy enforcement](../../data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md) for more information.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you have been introduced to the key Data Governance features on Real-Time CDP and how [!DNL Experience Platform] enables them, please continue to the [documentation for Data Governance on Adobe Experience Platform](../../data-governance/home.md). The documentation provides overviews of essential Data Governance concepts, as well as step-by-step workflows for managing data usage labels and policies.\n\nThe following video provides an overview of Data Governance in Real-Time CDP, including the use of marketing use-cases on destinations and example workflows for different scenarios:\n\n>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/33631?quality=12&learn=on)\n",

Check out the [error types](#error-types) section to see the expected status code, corresponding to each error type.\n\nErrors will be accompanied by a response body containing an error object. In this case, the response body contains a problem detail, as defined by [RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).\n\nThe returned content-type is the `application/problem+json` media type. When present, this response contains machine-readable details pertaining to the error. Problem details include a URI type.\n\nAll error objects have a `type`, `status`, `title`, `detail` and `report` message properties so that the API client can tell what the problem is.\n\n| Property | Type   | Description |\n| -------- | ------ | ----------- |\n| `type`  | String | A URI reference (RFC3986) that identifies the problem type, following the format `https://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/<ERROR-CODE>`. |\n| `status`   | Number | The HTTP status code generated by the server for this occurrence of the problem. |\n| `title`    | String | A short, human-readable summary of the problem type. |\n| `detail`   | String | A short, human-readable description of the problem type. |\n| `report`   | Object | A map of additional properties that aid in debugging such as the request ID or the org ID. In some cases, it might contain data specific to the error at hand, such as a list of validation errors. |\n\n```json\n{\n   \"type\":\"https://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/EXEG-0104-422\",\n   \"status\":422,\n   \"title\":\"Unprocessable entity\",\n   \"detail\":\"Invalid request (report attached). Please check your input and try again.\",\n   \"report\":{\n      \"errors\":[\n         \"Allowed Adobe version is 1.0 for standard 'Adobe' at index 0\",\n         \"Allowed IAB version is 2.0 for standard 'IAB TCF' at index 1\",\n         \"IAB consent string value must not be empty for standard 'IAB TCF' at index 1\"\n      ],\n      \"requestId\":\"0f8821e5-ed1a-4301-b445-5f336fb50ee8\",\n      \"orgId\":\"53A16ACB5CC1D3760A495C99@AdobeOrg\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Non-fatal errors {#non-fatal-errors}\n\nNon-fatal errors can be further broken down into:\n\n* Errors: Issues that occurred while processing the request, but did not cause the entire request to be rejected (eg. a non-critical upstream failure).\n* Warnings: Messages from upstream services which could signal that a partial processing of the request occurred.\n\nWhen encountering non-fatal errors (excluding warnings), the [!DNL Server API] will change the response status to `207 Multi-Status`.\n\nWarnings, on the other hand, are mostly informative, as they generally represent a potentially transient condition, which did not impact the request to full extent. One example here is a partial profile read in the segmentation engine, in which case the accuracy is impacted to some degree, but the functionality is still delivered.\n\nNon-fatal errors are represented in the _Problem Details_ format, but are embedded directly in Edge gateway's standard response, which is of type `application/json`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requestId\": \"72eaa048-207e-4dde-bf16-0cb2b21336d5\",\n  \"handle\": [\n  ],\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"https://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/EXEG-0201-503\",\n      \"status\": 503,\n      \"title\": \"The 'com.adobe.experience.platform.ode' service is temporarily unable to serve this request. Please try again later.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"warnings\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"https://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/EXEG-0204-200\",\n      \"status\": 200,\n      \"title\": \"A warning occurred while calling the 'com.adobe.audiencemanager' service for this request.\",\n      \"report\": {\n        \"cause\": {\n          \"message\": \"Cannot read related customer for device id: ...\",\n          \"code\": 202\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Handling `4xx` and `5xx` Responses\n\n\n|Error code|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`4xx Bad Request`| Most `4xx` errors, like 400, 403, 404, should not be retried on behalf of the client, except for `429`. These are client errors and will not succeed. The client must address the error before retrying the request.|\n|`429 Too Many Requests`| `429` HTTP response code indicates that the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network or an upstream service is rate limiting the requests. In this case, the  In such a scenario the caller must respect the `Retry-After` response header. Any responses flowing back must carry the HTTP response code with a domain specific error code.|\n|`500 Internal Server Error`| `500` errors are generic, catch-all errors. `500` errors must not be retried, except for `502` and `503`. Intermediaries must respond with a `500` error and may respond with a generic error code/message, or a more domain-specific error code/message.|\n|`502 Bad Gateway`| Indicates that the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network received an invalid response from upstream servers. This can happen due to network issues between servers. The temporary network issue may resolve and thus a retry may resolve the issue, so recipients of `502` errors may retry the request after some time.|\n|`503 Service Unavailable`| This error code indicates that the service is temporarily unavailable. This can happen during maintenance periods. Recipients of `503` errors may retry the request, but must respect the `Retry-After` header.|\n|`504 Gateway Timeout`| Indicates that Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network request to the upstream servers has timed-out. This can happen due to network issues between servers, DNS issues, or other network issues. The temporary network issues may be resolved after some time and a retry may solve the issue.|\n",

You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.\n\n**New or updated features** {#destinations-new-updated-features}\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| [Consent Policy enhancement](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#consent-policy-enhancement) for integrations with [file-based (batch) destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#file-based) | <p> When profiles are no longer qualified for a consent policy, Experience Platform now proactively communicates their policy exit to file-based destinations. This follows the [release in February 2023](/help/release-notes/2023/january-2023.md#destinations-new-updated-functionality) of the same functionality for streaming destinations. </p> <p> <b>Note</b>: This functionality is available only to customers of **[!UICONTROL Privacy and Security Shield]**, and those of **[!UICONTROL Healthcare Shield]**. </p> |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\n**New or updated documentation** {#destinations-new-updated-documentation}\n\n| Documentation | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| How destinations work documentation| <p>We published three new explainer articles about how destinations work, based on common questions from users:</p> <p><ul><li>[Configurable and common export settings in destinations](/help/destinations/how-destinations-work/destinations-configurations.md)</li><li>[Profile export behavior for different destination types](/help/destinations/how-destinations-work/profile-export-behavior.md)</li><li>[Identity handling in the destinations activation workflow](/help/destinations/how-destinations-work/identity-handling.md)</li></p> |\n\nFor more general information on destinations, refer to the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).\n\n## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}\n\nXDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.\n\n**Updated features**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Field deprecation through the UI | You can now [deprecate fields from your schemas after data has been ingested](../../xdm/tutorials/field-deprecation-ui.md). XDM field deprecation allows you to remove fields from UI view while retaining them for use. You can reveal deprecated fields again if needed, and any segments, queries or downstream solutions that reference the fields will run as usual. |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\n**New XDM components**\n\n| Component type | Name | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class | [[!UICONTROL XDM Individual Prospect Profile]](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1669/files) | The XDM Individual Prospect Profile class brings in partner-provided IDs. |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\n**Updated XDM components**\n\n| Component type | Name | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Field group | [!UICONTROL Frequency Capping Constraints] | The [!UICONTROL Frequency Capping Constraints] field group has been [updated to support repeat and custom events](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1641/files). |\n| Data type | [!UICONTROL Web referrer] | Web referrer properties have been [updated to include `xdm:linkName` and `xdm:linkRegion`](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1666/files). Respectively, these are the name and region of the HTML element that was selected on the previous page. |\n| Field Group | [!UICONTROL Adobe CJM ExperienceEvent - Message interaction details] | [The [!UICONTROL Tracker URL] field was added](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1665/files) to the [!UICONTROL Adobe CJM ExperienceEvent]. This tracker provides the URL selected by the user. |\n| Field Group | [!UICONTROL Adobe CJM ExperienceEvent - Message interaction detail] | [The empty `meta:enum` property was removed](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1668/files) from the URL [!UICONTROL Tracking Type] field. |\n| Data type  | [!UICONTROL Media information] | [The regex pattern from the `videoSegment` property in [!UICONTROL Media information] datatype was removed](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1667/files). |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\nFor more information on XDM in Platform, read the [XDM System overview](../../xdm/home.md).\u200b\n\n## Query Service {#query-service}\n\nQuery Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Lake]. You can join any datasets from data lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-Time Customer Profile.\n\n**Updated features**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enable datasets for profile with SQL | [Use LABELs in CTAS queries to make a dataset 'profile enabled'](../../query-service/sql/syntax.md#create-table-as-select), or use ALTER to update existing datasets to be enabled for profile. You can use this extended SQL construct to provide seamless support for derived attributes for your Real-Time Customer Profile business use cases. See the [Seamless SQL flow for derived attributes document](../../query-service/data-distiller/derived-attributes/seamless-sql-flow.md) for more details. |\n| Monitor scheduled queries | Use the [Scheduled Queries tab](../../query-service/ui/monitor-queries.md) to find important information about your query runs and subscribe to alerts. Monitor queries for schedule details, status, and error messages/codes should they fail.  |\n| Toggle auto-complete feature  | Eliminate certain metadata commands and improve processing times by [toggling the Query Editor auto-complete feature](../../query-service/ui/user-guide.md#auto-complete). This feature automatically suggests potential SQL keywords and table details for the query as you write it. |\n| Dataset samples | Specify a sampling rate in your query and [use dataset samples to create a uniform random sample](../../query-service/essential-concepts/dataset-samples.md), or create conditional samples based on specific criteria. |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\nFor more information on Query Services, refer to the [Query Service overview](../../query-service/home.md).\n\n\n## Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition {#b2b}\n\nBuilt on Real-Time Customer Data Platform (Real-Time CDP), Real-Time CDP B2B Edition is purpose-built for marketers operating in a business-to-business service model.

This unified data allows marketers to precisely target specific audiences and engage those audiences across all available channels.\n\n**Updated features**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enable related accounts service| The new toggle function allows you to enable the related accounts service on your account. For more information, read the guide on [enabling the related accounts service](../../rtcdp/b2b-ai-ml-services/related-accounts.md#enable). |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\nTo learn more about Real-Time CDP B2B Edition, read the [Real-Time CDP B2B Edition overview](../../rtcdp/overview.md).\n\n## Sources {#sources}\n\nAdobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources and allows you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.\n\nExperience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.\n\n**Updated features**\n\n| Feature | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Designate subscription-level access with [!DNL Google PubSub] | You can now define access to a specific topic subscription when using the [!DNL Google PubSub] source by providing the subscription ID when authenticating. For more information, read the [!DNL Google PubSub] authentication tutorial [using the Flow Service API](../../sources/tutorials/api/create/cloud-storage/google-pubsub.md) or [Platform UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/cloud-storage/google-pubsub.md). |\n| Ingest custom activity data from [!DNL Marketo] | You can now bring custom activity data from your [!DNL Marketo] instance to Experience Platform. To ingest custom activity data, you must set up custom activities field groups in the B2B Activities schema and create a dataflow using the activities dataset. Once the dataflow is complete, the ingested dataset will contain both standard and custom activities from your [!DNL Marketo] instance. You can then use [Query Service](../../query-service/home.md) to access your custom activity records on Platform. For more information, read the guide on [creating a dataflow for custom activity data](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/marketo-custom-activities.md). |\n| Exclude unclaimed accounts from [!DNL Marketo] | You can now configure whether you want to exclude or include unclaimed accounts from ingestion when creating a dataflow for companies data. For more information, read the guide on [creating a source connection and dataflow for [!DNL Marketo]](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/marketo.md). |\n\n{style=\"table-layout:auto\"}\n\nTo learn more about sources, read the [sources overview](../../sources/home.md).\n",

For example, in an email campaign called \"Did you forget to buy your sneakers?\", you may want an audience of all users who searched for running shoes within the last 30 days, but who did not complete a purchase. Using different segments, you can focus on your various audiences, delivering a more customized marketing experience.\n\n## [!DNL Segment Builder]\n\n[!DNL Platform] allows you to easily create and access segments, as well as use different building blocks to further characterize your segments. For more information about how to use the Segment Builder, please read the [Segment Builder guide](./segment-builder-guide.md).\n\n## Customer AI\n\nCustomer AI, included with Real-Time Customer Data Platform, provides you with the power to generate customer predictions at the individual level with explanations.\n\nWith the help of influential factors, Customer AI can tell you what a customer is likely to do and why. Additionally, you can benefit from Customer AI predictions and insights to personalize customer experiences by serving the most appropriate offers and messaging. Customer AI can assist with:\n\n* Providing high accuracy customer propensity models for stronger segmentation and targeting.\n* Understanding the influential factors and likelihood behind certain customer behaviors.\n* Providing customizable options for your company's unique use cases and data.\n* Enhancing Real-Time Customer Profile with customer propensity scores such as churn and conversion.\n* Enhancing customer profiles with influential factors for propensity scores.\n* Creating segments of customers based on influential factors and propensity scores.\n\nCustomer AI is located in the **[!UICONTROL Services]** tab under **[!UICONTROL Adobe services]**.\n\n![Customer AI location](../assets/overview/rtcdp-customer-ai.png)\n\n### Getting started with Customer AI\n\nIn order to get started with Customer AI you need to follow the [data preperation tutorial](../../intelligent-services/data-preparation.md) and configure the input schema based on your use case. Next, you will need to [configure a Customer AI instance](../../intelligent-services/customer-ai/user-guide/configure.md). After configuring an instance, a model is generated where you can [view your insights and scores](../../intelligent-services/customer-ai/user-guide/discover-insights.md). Using the data generated from your model, you can create segments for data driven activation.\n\nTo learn more about Customer AI, start by visiting the [Customer AI overview](../../intelligent-services/customer-ai/overview.md). Additionally, the following video shows how Customer AI enriches customer profiles with AI-based propensities and empowers customer segmentation and targeting efforts.\n\n>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/40374/?quality=12&learn=on)\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter reading this overview, you should now understand how Real-Time CDP utilizes [!DNL Segmentation Service] to enhance customization and personalization of marketing campaigns.
